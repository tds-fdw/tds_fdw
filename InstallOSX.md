## Installing on OSX

This document will show how to install tds_fdw on OSX using the [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager for the required packages.

### Install FreeTDS

The TDS foreign data wrapper requires a library that implements the DB-Library interface,
such as [FreeTDS](http://www.freetds.org).

```bash
brew install freetds
```

Note: If you install FreeTDS from another source, e.g. [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org), you might have to adjust the value for `TDS_INCLUDE` in the make calls below  (e.g. `-I/opt/local/include/freetds` for MacPorts).

### Install PostgreSQL

If you need to install PostgreSQL, do so by following the [apt installation directions](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt). For example, to install PostgreSQL 9.5 on Ubuntu:

```bash
brew install postgres
```

Or use Postgres.app: <http://postgresapp.com/>

### Install tds_fdw

#### Build from release package

If you'd like to use one of the release packages, you can download and install them via something like the following:

```bash
export TDS_FDW_VERSION="2.0.5"
wget https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw/archive/v${TDS_FDW_VERSION}.tar.gz
tar -xvzf v${TDS_FDW_VERSION}.tar.gz
cd tds_fdw-${TDS_FDW_VERSION}
make USE_PGXS=1 TDS_INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/include/
sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
```

**NOTE:** If you have several PostgreSQL versions and you do not want to build for the default one, first locate where the binary for `pg_config` is, take note of the full path, and then append `PG_CONFIG=<PATH>` after `USE_PGXS=1` at the `make` commands.

#### Build from repository

If you would rather use the current development version, you can clone and build the git repository via something like the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tds-fdw/tds_fdw.git
cd tds_fdw
make USE_PGXS=1 TDS_INCLUDE=-I/usr/local/include/
sudo make USE_PGXS=1 install
```

**NOTE:** If you have several PostgreSQL versions and you do not want to build for the default one, first locate where the binary for `pg_config` is, take note of the full path, and then append `PG_CONFIG=<PATH>` after `USE_PGXS=1` at the `make` commands.

#### Start server

If this is a fresh installation, then start the server:

```bash
brew services start postgresql
```

Or the equivalent command if you are not using Homebrew.

#### Install extension

```bash
psql -U postgres
postgres=# CREATE EXTENSION tds_fdw;
```
